# CraftChat Plugin

Craft Chat is the Chat Plugin designed for the Craft Minecraft Network.  Custom chat client to link servers, and link back to a master database through api

## Ideas

* **HelpOp** 
 * Will search for staff on other servers that are part of the network, will shop the helpop message to only the staff that can help
 * Have a reply command so user knows if someone is on the way to help (Maybe?)
 * Let the user know if noone is on that can help

* **Msg**
 * Inner server messaging, if on friends list
 * Check if user is on local server, if so message that user
 * If user is no on local server, check with master server to see if online, if online check if part of friend network, if so send message
 * Let user know if the user is not online, or not part of friend network if they are

* **Friend** 
 * Allow users to create friend networks
 * Will show list on logon which friends are online and what server they are on
 * Friend will see message saying "Your friend, <name> has logged into <server>
 * Friend will need to accept new friends

## Commands
* **/msg <name> <message>** - Sens name message
* **/tell <name>** - start private conversation with this user
* **/tell <name> <message>** - Same as /msg
* **/r <message>** - Send a reply to the last person to message you
* **/helpop <message>** - Sends message to staff on current server you are on (will send to staff of the server you are on, even if on a different server)
